SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
    SVGs are html elements
    when looking to show svg elements:
        first add the element to your html file
        you have to give a height and width
        SVG's once added act like a canvas on which one can paint
    SVG's top right corner is referred to as the origin
        the x-axis increases from left to right and 
        the y-axis increases from top to bottom
    Onto the canvas, one can place different shapes including:
        polygons( triangles, squares and rectangles included)
        Ellipses ( circles included)
        paths as well
    The radius of a circle is set using r
        in our instance, the cx and cy are the center points of our circle 
    If there are parts of an shape is the SVG that are invisible, it means that they simply 
      overlap the bounds of our SVG canvas
    One can add as many shapes into an SVG as one pleases.

    //Circles in svg's
        The inner part oof the circle is calles the fill
        the outer is called the stroke
        There's a way to set the stroke styling using the stroke
         -dasharray property which let's you pick out the size of the 
         strokes and subsequently, the size of the space between the 
         strokes
         The stroke always begins at 3 o'clock
         There's the stroke dash-offset which creates an additional space between the start point of the
         stroke and the end point where the start and end meet
         One can use the dashoffset in negative to get it moving in a clockwise direction
        the transform property allows you to rotate the shape
         notation: transform = "rotate(-90 100 100)
          the above notation simply means we expect the shape to be rotated around the point
          100 px from the origin, both on the x and y axis, 90 degrees anticlockwise allowing the 
          dashoffset to begin at the 12 o'clock point.
            unlike in the sizing, one cannot use percentage points to dictate the position of the
            rotation center
        It's important to note than JS calculations cannot be done on the shape if the proportions are listed in 
         percentage points
